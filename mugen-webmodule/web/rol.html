EXPERTISE

<p>The institutions listed below have achieved lasting recognition as sites that provide high-quality genotyping and phenotyping services on a contract basis. Academic entities usually accept only small projects from external collaborators, whereas the industrial concerns can perform larger projects. <u>Important Note:</u> I strongly, <b>strongly</b>, <b><i>STRONGLY</i></b> urge researchers who intend to employ a contract phenotyping facility to consult the prospective service provider <i>before</i> the rodents are scheduled to be analyzed. Ignore this recommendation and you invite an acute case of GIGO (&ldquo;garbage in, garbage out&rdquo;) syndrome that will slow or even halt the productivity of your mouse phenogenomic efforts.</p>
